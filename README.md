# Rock Paper Scissors Result #

A method that returns the result of the classic 'rock paper scissors' game.

This is a small kata that I have created to practice using Ruby to help develop my skills.

The program is to be run on the command line to display the result.

You can edit the result by changing the parameters passed (player moves) in the method.

## How to use ##

Open the file in a text editor and add player moves to the parameters.

```shell
ruby rockpaperscissors.rb
```
